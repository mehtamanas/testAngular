# Angular-Master
* All Angular code is to be checked into this repository. Do not check in any other code into this repo. 
* Only commit code files you are ready to publish. Do not commit files which are not ready to be published.
* Do not commit files such as exe's, images etc. Your .gitignore will take care of this already. Do not modify the .gitignore. 
* Everyone except admins should check into the branch with their own name. DO NOT check into any other branch.
